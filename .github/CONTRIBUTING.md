# Contribution Guide

To encourage active collaboration, Smashed Egg encourages pull requests, not just bug reports.

Pull requests will only be reviewed when marked as "ready for review" (not in the "draft" state) and all tests for new features are passing.
Pull requests in a stale state, i.e. left in the "draft" state, will be closed after a few days.


# Development Discussion

You may propose new features or improvements of existing Smashed Egg packages in the relevant GitHub discussion board [here](https://github.com/smashed-egg/laravel-auth-route-bindings/discussions). 

If you propose a new feature, please be willing to implement at least some of the code that would be needed to complete the feature.
